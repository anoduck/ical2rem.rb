<tt>ical2rem.rb</tt> is based on the Perl program <tt>ical2rem.pl</tt> by Justin B. 
Alcorn (http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/ICal2Rem). It converts an
<em>iCalendar</em> file's <tt>VEVENT</tt> and <tt>VTODO</tt> components to the
<em>Remind</em> syntax. You should be able to use it as a drop-in replacement
for <tt>ical2rem.pl</tt> with only minor modifications. The command line client
which comes with ical2rem.rb is called <tt>ical2rem-cli</tt> and can be found in
the <tt>/bin</tt> directory.

= Installation

<tt>ical2rem.rb</tt> requires RiCal (http://ri-cal.rubyforge.org/) You can
install it with RubyGems:

  # (sudo) gem install ri_cal

<tt>ical2rem.rb</tt> itself has a gemspec file, so you can easily build a gem
and install it with:

  # gem build ical2rem.rb.gemspec
  # gem install ical2rem.rb.-x.x.x.gem

Besides that, no further installation steps are required.


= Usage

You can get usage information by running <tt>ical2rem-cli</tt> with the
<tt>-h</tt> switch:

  Usage: ical2rem-cli [options] < input-file [> output-file]
          --label LABEL                Calendar name
          --lead-time LEAD             Advance days to start reminders
          --heading HEADING            Define a priority for static entries
      -t, --todos                      Process TODOs?
      -c, --config-file FILE           Use config file FILE (default: .ical2rem.yaml)
      -d, --debug                      Show debug info
      -h, --help                       Show this help

The configuration file (default <tt>.ical2rem.yaml</tt>) further explains the
options you can supply.

<tt>ical2rem-cli</tt> will read any iCalendar file parseable by RiCal from
<tt>STDIN</tt> and print its output to <tt>STDOUT</tt>.


= Overview

<tt>ical2rem.rb</tt> was mainly written because <tt>ICal::Parser</tt>, the iCal
parsing library <tt>ical2rem.pl</tt> uses, bailed out on my 64bit Ubuntu I was
using at the time. Also, <tt>ical2rem.pl</tt> does not support showing starting
and ending times of events.

The first version used Sam Roberts' vPim, but since it didn't work well with
Ruby 1.9 for some time, I decided to switch to RiCal.

==== Events

<tt>ical2rem.rb</tt> parses iCalendar <tt>VEVENTs</tt> in a similar way to
<tt>ical2rem.pl</tt>, but it will also recognize <tt>TIME-DATE</tt> values in
<tt>DTSTART</tt> and <tt>DTEND</tt> and add them to the output by using remind's
<tt>DURATION</tt> property.

==== ToDos 

Like <tt>ical2rem.pl</tt>, <tt>ical2rem.rb</tt> also parses iCalendar
<tt>VTODOs</tt>. Unlike <tt>ical2rem.pl</tt>, <tt>ical2rem-cli</tt> will not
parse them by default, parsing has to be enabled with the command line switch
'-t'. At the moment, the same simple approach to parsing as in
<tt>ical2rem.pl</tt> is used. This may improve in future versions.
